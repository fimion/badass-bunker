A big note is that I could not get movement to work and look nicely having it be "flight: 2 squares". Instead, I created a conditional script where if you type move 1 or flight 2, it adds an icon indicating what type of movement it is. So it will appear as a feather and 2 Squares for Flight, Waves and 2 Squares for swim, and so on. As a bonus, enemies can have multiple move types with this system and it will fit. The readme includes details on how to use it. 





Secondly, A loot area was added as an Optional section. Its not intended to take the place of the massive loot generation tables. More, to add perhaps quest specific items, flavor items, or something you really want to always include on this specific entity, as these can be saved within the plugins' internal bestiary. 





Thirdly, I made a big decision to leave fonts as defaults for now. In Obsidian, there are a lot of themes, and at first I was trying to apply borderlands specific fonts, it was not consistently working in the css against all themes I tried, I may tackle this again later. 





This is just pass 1. Second pass will include some more QoL updates as I add creatures in and see what needs to be tweaked. It will also include color-specific layouts for bosses as we see in the book. Pass 1 already has support for the additional headers for bosses.
