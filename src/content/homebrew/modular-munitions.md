BM’s, are you tired of rolling guns, only for your players to junk them in favor of that legendary they rolled at Lv 1? Players, are you tired of not having the level of loot anxiety you expect from a Borderlands game? Introducing Mr.Sandman’s More Modular Munitions! Roll buckets of dice for slightly more powerful and vastly more variable firearms!
