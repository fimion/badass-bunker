I started this back when Cyberpunk Edgerunners came out.

Why did I do this?

1. I've run a couple of games so far and about half of the PCs in my games have all had some form of Cybernetic limbs. I find it frustrating that this is pretty much always just a flavor thing and I wanted there to be some kind of gameplay impact to having Cybernetics.

 2. As it stands, there Isn't much for players to spend their gold on. So, pretty much everthing having to do with ECHOmancy is only gated by how much money the player is willing to spend.

 3. I wanted to expand upon the concept of ECHOmancy that is only touched on in the book. I decided that I'd kill two birds with one stone and tie a players ECHO device directly with their Cyberware Mods.





This is obviously heavily based on Cyberpunk Red and 2077 but I did try to change the concepts just enough to fit the spirit of B&B.

Its still not exactly what I'd consider 'done,' but I definitely would like to get some feedback on what's here.
