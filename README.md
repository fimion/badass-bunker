# The Badass Bunker

A collection of Resources for the Bunkers and Badasses Homebrew community.

## üóÇÔ∏è Structure

This is an Astro site so let's discus the setup a bit

### `/src/`

This is where the majority of the code for our project lives. Within it we have a few directories that are important.

#### `/src/content`

This is where all our content lives. If you are wanting to add/edit a resource, this is where it will be. Most homebrew 
resources will live in `homebrew` but this will update as we add features.

#### `/src/pages`

Need to add a new page that isn't a resource? This is where it'll go.

#### `/src/layouts`

This is where the layouts live. A layout is a special component that wraps an entire page.

Need to make some reusable markup? Put it in here! We can add Astro/Vue/React components.

#### `/src/shared`

#### `/src/styles`

Put your global styles in here!

### `/public`

All files in this folder will be bundled into the published site. Add images, fonts, etc here.
